#  Court Outcome Prediction (NLP)
###A Machine Learning Project for Predicting Court Case Outcomes Using Legal Text

This project predicts whether a court case will be **affirmed** or **reversed** based on the written **facts** of the case.
Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning, the system analyzes legal text and learns patterns in judicial reasoning to classify the final case outcome.

## What’s Done

* Loaded and explored the legal case dataset
* Cleaned and preprocessed the text data
* Converted dispositions into binary labels
* Prepared the data for model training

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

1. **Python**
2. **Pandas** (data loading & cleaning)
3. **NumPy**
4. **NLTK / spaCy** (text preprocessing)
5. **Scikit-learn** (machine learning models)
6. **TF-IDF vectorization**
7. *(Optional later)* FastAPI / Flask for model deployment
